# spring-abac-sample
A example application to show the usage of spring-abac


spring-abac is currently offered to spring as a pull request.

Until then you need to checkout my spring-specurity fork from https://github.com/simplicii/spring-security
and build it on your own.

Or download the SNAPSHOT jar from this repository: https://github.com/simplicii/spring-abac-sample/blob/master/lib/spring-security-abac-5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
